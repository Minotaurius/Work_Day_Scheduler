## Work Day Scheduler Application

## User Story
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## Description of application

In it's final form this application gives users a way to track their hectic life schedule. Once typing a "thing" that needs to get done....it will be saved in that time slot using local storage and upon reload of application will display again for user what things they have to do at what times. Application is still not complete and needs final touches.
